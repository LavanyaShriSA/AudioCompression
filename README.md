A discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based audio compression method. DFT is used to transform the audio signal to frequency components. It is compressed by choosing lesser values from DFT magnitude spectrum. The values are selected by either dominant n components or first n components. Then Inverse DFT is used to convert the spectrum back to time domain. Sliding rectangular and triangular windows are multiplied with the audio streams before performing the N-point FFT. The experiment is carried out for different values of N, namely 64, 128, 256 and the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed signal is obtained for each N. The results are summarized for different number of peaks used (n).
